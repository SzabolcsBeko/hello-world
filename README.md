Hello World!
============

Hello Guys!

I like Java programming language and I am interested in designing software systems using UML.
Programming distributed and microservice based systems using Spring Boot. 
In addition I like to use frameworks such as Liferay, Apache Wicket.
I also interested in different test technics or methodologies like TestNG,JRebel,Selinium tests.

Ok, I don't need another readme-edit branch, do I try to delete it.
